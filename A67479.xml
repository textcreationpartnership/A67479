            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O love our Neighbour as our ſelves, though it be very good, yet ſince it ſignifies to make them as happy as our ſelves: Our judgments had need be right, both as to our own, and their good: Or we may ſoon render them very miſerable, when we leaſt intend it, by perſwading them into the ſame path of ruine which (through mistake) our ſelves would have taken for our preſervation.</p>
            <p>And therefore, that every well-willer may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualified to be a friend, nothing is more needful then to get Wiſdom, and underſtanding in all the main occaſions of this life, that ſo as our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons make us apt and ready to adviſe, our well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested Reaſon and Conſcience may render our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb facs="tcp:56217:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> always good, and profitable to thoſe we give it.</p>
            <p>And truly if in any thing theſe are uſeful Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they muſt needs be ſo in thoſe of Phyſick; wherein as there are vaſt differences, and ſmallest Errours, often mortal, ſo unleſs thoſe who in times of ſickneſs are forward to perſwade, are not alſo in good meaſure able to diſtinguiſh what's ſafe and powerful, from what's hazardous, painful, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous both as to Methods, and Medicines, their friendſhip would much better be ſnewed in ſilence, than in ſpeaking, or adviſing.</p>
            <p>Which, yet, being but cold comfort; And that to get knowledge is every ones duty, that they may be helpful in time of need. None ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtand averſe from endeavouring, or be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in their hopes of obtaining ſo much skill at leaſt: As in an inſtant, to make a ſafe and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional choice where the difference is ſo manifeſt; as in your ſerious reading of this Diſcourſe will plainly appear, even in this (hitherto) much obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Science of Phyſick.</p>
            <p>The Scripture ſaith, a merry heart doth good like a Medicine: And if ſo, in true conſequence, ought not the Operations and Effects of kindly and real Medicines, to reſemble thoſe of a merry heart? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it can be no abſur dity to expect it.</p>
            <p>Now, who knoweth not that a merry heart joyned with vertue and prudence (for ſuch only the holy
<pb facs="tcp:56217:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> Scriptures can intend) performeth all its good, by inſenſibly diſperſing a moſt lively and benigne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence throughout the body, to the joy, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and felicity of the whole man, without any the leaſt disturbance, pain, or danger whatſoever?</p>
            <p>And if Medicines are, or can be found, through whoſe friendly and powerful operations, all ſadneſs, and ſickneſs, may without pain or trouble be total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Expelled and Exſtinguiſhed, why ſhould they not be known, ſought after, and chearfully embraced?</p>
            <p>But that there are ſuch in being, having throwly peruſed this Diſcourſe, you will be well aſſured; and that they are ſecurely to be truſted to for cure in all caſes. The manifold Instances of their real performances, will aſcertain paſt all ſcruple. And which throughly read, &amp; noted in all particulars, will ſoon enable you to cure your ſelvs, or friends, &amp; to find what is moſt proper in thoſe, or any other Diſtempers; and by their Marks you will really diſtinguiſh them from ſuch as are improper, hazardous or dangerous.</p>

            <p>And though men for the moſt part ſeldom va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue any thing, though never ſo uſeful and precious, untill they immediately need them. Yet experience will tell you, it is neither ſafe nor prudent at ſuch times to be to learn: But rather to be aforchand with all neceſſary knowledge; To give due and juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to every thing according to its worth: And
<pb facs="tcp:56217:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſo to ſtand like wiſe and wary perſons, always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and prepared in every Exigence and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Sickneſs or Diſtemper: To take the ſureſt courſe, and to give the ſoundeſt and moſt aſſured advice to Neighbours, Friends, and Relations in all their extremities.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56217:5"/> delightful Diet. It cannot but imply and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, that whatſoever is adminiſtred in times of ſickneſs, or extremity, ſhould not only be highly vertuous, reſpecting the Diſtemper, but alſo of ſo benign, pure, and truly Humane Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, that they may be taken with as much ſecurity and delight, as the moſt wholeſome and pleaſant Diet: And which if admitted into Diet, may be as advantagious to the conſervation of Healh and life, as in the moſt venomous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers they are unto recovery: inducing alſo a belief, that until Medicine be ſo ordered, (let who will be the confident preſcribers) Phyſick; the great ſuſtainer of mankind, is not in its true exalted ſtate, but in a ſordid, low, and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed condition unfit for Humane Conſtitutions, and not to be truſted in times of ſickneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.</p>
            <p>And from ſuch Contemplations as theſe, it hath been that I have deemed nothing proper to be given in ſickneſs to any perſon, old or young, but what may be ſafely, and profitably taken by thoſe in health.</p>
            <p>And if from hence, and out of my tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the diſtreſſed and diſmal times of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I have indeavoured all I could, and bent all my Studies for the obtaining of ſuch kindly, and Powerful Medicines, as thereby ſafely to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, and wholly to abandon all thoſe trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, painful, hazardous, and dangerous ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56217:5"/> and Ingredients too to uſual in practice; (It being too ſad a time to add affliction to affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) as I have much comfort therein; ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my charitable intentions, ſufficiently juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Text: The truly Chriſtian Vertu eof <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> being as eſſentially needful in a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, as in the moſt tender hearted Samaritan: and without an eminent proportion whereof (what ever other parts or Arts abound) none ought, in juſtice, to be owned as a competeut Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in times of ſuch neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Nor did I decline the common Road of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, for any other cauſe Imaginable, but for its manifeſt uncertainty in Principles, Roughneſs, Harſhneſs, and Cruelty in Methods; Improprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Impotency, and danger in Medicines. Nor found out any way to relieve my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when firſt at ſo great a loſs, but by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing my thoughts from out the wilderneſs of all the uncertain Notions and Gueſſes of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, and giving them free liberty in the walks of Scripture; <hi>Where the true Original of man,</hi> the ſole ſubject of Phyſick (hid from Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy) being apparent, and the <hi>ſublimity of the true Humane Temperature thence deducible;</hi> I ſoon diſcerned that all miſcarriages in Phiſick, proceeded from the admiſſion of groſs, viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and dangerous materials into practice, together with other Rugged and Boyſterous handling; And for want of aſſimulating, all

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56217:6"/> verily believe) with very Effective Propenſions in Nature, and with a Palate ſuitably exerciſed in the Diſcerning of the Spirits, and bent to the Diſcovery of the Vertues of materials, whereby all Compounds, as well as Simples, lay open to my aſſiſtance, with a mind thus furniſhed, and prepared, reſolving neither to flatter, nor indulge my ſelf in trifling inſignificant Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor to be ſtartled in ſo Worthy and Needfull an Attempt, by any Difficulties; <hi>with due Submiſſions,</hi> I propoſed my End, made choice of Materials, wrought them into the conſiſtence and Qualities of real Medicines, ſatisfied my Palate in their taſt, proved them upon my ſelf; and as cauſe required, either altered, or immediately fixt them for general Uſe and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</p>
            <p>In which way of proceeding, in proceſs of time, I became ſo happy, as to ſatisfie my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in the Production of ſo large a variety of kindly and powerful Medicines, ſo Equally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to mens Natures, and ſo peculiarly qualified for particular Diſtempers, as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed for all Occaſions and Neceſſities: And which ever ſince they had a being, have with that conſtancy wrought ſo many remarkable Cures; that I now deem my ſelf bound in duty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them as the moſt proper <hi>Phyſick for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi> according to the Titles, judging I ſhould highly offend, if I ſhould fail of my uttermoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56217:7"/> to beget a right and thorow under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of their performances.</p>
            <p>And this, not only becauſe of the manifeſt good they bring with them, in theiruſe (with ſafety) but alſo for that abſolute exemption from all thoſe <hi>troubleſome, painful, hazardous, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous proceedings,</hi> with which the general courſe of practiſe is ſadly and grievouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred.</p>
            <p>A brief view of the particulars <hi>whereof,</hi> may here be needful, that every one may ſee and lay to heart, how much more dreadful, painful, and Dangerous the afflicted times of ſickneſs are thereby rendred, and what an unſpeakable happineſs it would be both to all Conſcionable, Compaſſionate Phyſitians, and all conſiderate Patients to have ſuch Medicines alwayes in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, by which all thoſe Evils and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences may Safely, and ſecurely be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>The firſt of which moleſters of the ſick, in the uſual courſe of practice, are commonly <hi>Gliſters;</hi> which how innocent and harmleſs ſoever they are eſteemed, are nevertheleſs attended with more Trouble and Danger then is conſidered: For beſides their preſſing over hard upon the modeſty of the more baſhful natures, and ſo Diſturbing their minds, by the odd poſition and Diſtaſtful handling of the body; they alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe very much to the taking, or increaſing of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56217:7"/> Colds, and exceedingly diſorder, when Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Sleep are moſt deſirable. But how they amaze with fears, when they one after another work not at all, as often befalls to extream pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and how dreadfully they affright when they work too much, as ſometimes they do, in my apprehentſion deſerves very much conſideration; Eſpecially ſince in their mildeſt working, the ſtate of the body and Diſtemper may be ſuch, as they may prove no leſs then mortal, by diverting and withdrawing the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits from their more needful combating the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, to this needleſs operation, and conſequently leaving Nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute in her greateſt extremity.</p>
            <p>Nor is the very manual part, how ſlight ſo ever the moſt make of it, altogether free from the moſt feared effect. It having been known where a ſmall errour in the Hand adminiſtring, hath occaſioned an incurable Ulcer; And therefore all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances duly weighed, it muſt be deemed a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great advantage to underſtand the uſe of ſuch Medicines, as bring an abſolute freedom from all thoſe Troubles, Hazards, and Mortal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Gliſters,</hi> the next afflicter of the ſick, is generally <hi>Bleeding,</hi> a practice not ſo frequent in former, as in latter times, and both highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and every whit as much condemned by perſons equally Learned; So that in this,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56217:8"/> their Trumpet gives an uncertain ſound, And ſome who are famous upon Record, Eſteemed it the more proper work of worthy Phyſitians to rectifie rather then draw and waſt it in times of ſickneſs, when Nature moſt needeth its aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, of which cautious judgment alſo ſeem the <hi>Chineſes</hi> and the <hi>Bannian</hi> Phyſitians, but later times and Operators are at that paſs, as if they made little more of it then drawing of their breaths, and ſo they tearm it but breathing of a Vein, though with their favour it be not ſo eaſily recruited, and beſides that many times the bleeders breath their laſt by it, or by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof.</p>
            <p>And truly, though thoſe who uſually order it, ſeldom make the obſervation; yet for the moſt part, the perſons concern'd, and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations caſt but Diſmal looks upon it, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs themſelves thereunto, with much Diſmay and Trembling (oftentimes ſwouning away under the Bleeders hands,) as a thing of much uncertainty and over much danger, the Event frequently ſo proving, not any one proceeding in Phyſick, being more complained of, nor any whereunto the failing of patients is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted; and that with juſtice too, for what worſe can befall afflicted Patients, overborn, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the violent aſſaults of ſome Veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Diſtempers; then to have their main forces, their Spirits drawn off from making thoſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56217:8"/> needful Defences whereunto by Nature they are aſſigned, and upon which it moſt dependeth for her preſervation?</p>
            <p>And what wonder is it, if ſoon after a little flattery and ſhadows of relief, fuddain Deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions immediately follow thereupon, and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon Nature thus betrayed, prevail beyond all poſſibility of recovery, as (were Record<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> kept thereof) would be ſadly ſeen in every weeks experience.</p>
            <p>And as it is but ſmall relief to ſhew how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny recover after bleeding; The Courſe in it ſelf being ſo hazardous, and of ten Mortal: ſo as little comfort it is to ſhew the ill, or rather odd Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of the cooled and congealed Blood, which is known to be but fallacious trifling, to amuſe bewailing and Diſconſolate people, neither goodneſs, nor badneſs being at all aſcertained thereby.</p>
            <p>And be it how it will, is generally the beſt friend the body hath, and conſequently never to be ſeparated; nor indeed is ever needful where ſuch Medicines are in readineſs, as are Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally qualified for Extinguiſhing of the Veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Cauſes of Diſeaſes: And for Purifying and Rectifying both of the Blood and Spirits, wherein chiefly conſiſteth the Worth or Ability of Phyſitians, and the Reality and Excellency of Medicines.</p>
            <p>And without which, upon every Exigence
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56217:9"/> there is ſuch Hurrying, Starting, and Puthering, one while with a Gliſter, then with Bleeding, ſometimes the Arm, the Tongue, or other parts, and theſe ſuddenly again repeated, to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream affrightment of the afflicted Patient, and all his ſad Relations; and all this upon meer Caſual, uncertain Grounds, as to what the iſſue may be, or whether condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to Life or Death: A hazard of a ſtrange na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for Patients to adventure the parting with, and loſs both of their Blood and Spirits, upon which Death ſo often follows, when the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian runs none at all, <hi>Secundum Artem,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing even to the utmoſt ſcruple of Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if not of Conſcience, which poſſibly may yet often ſuggeſt that they ought to have been provided, and to have plyed thoſe (who ſo highly truſted them) with ſuch really power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and benigne Medicines, as they cannot but have heard and been aſſured to have diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt, Violent, Venomous Diſtempers without this unmerciful Experiment of bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which alſo in the very action, through a ſmall miſcarriage of the hand pricking a Nerve, hath loſt the uſe of an Arm or Hand, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times through an enſuing Gangrene proved ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Deſtructive.</p>
            <p>Why therefore, all theſe Particulars conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this Bleeding, or bloody practice ſhould longer continue in repute, eſpecially ſince ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Inſtances, are ſo generally diſcourſed,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56217:9"/> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> That after the many times bleeding of ſome perſons, the laſt fits of their Diſtempers imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before death, were (without any miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation by all that waſt of Blood) as vehement and Rigorous, as in any time of their ſickneſs, which inſtances in reaſon ought to remind every conſcionable Phyſitian, and every prudent Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of this important Truth, that it is not this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and uncomfortable courſe of bleeding; But the reality of kindly and powerful Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, that (under God) is moſt hopefully to be relied on for cure in all Extremities.</p>
            <p>After bleeding, in the uſual courſe ſoon follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Purging, but very ill deſerving, that plauſible Title. Moſt of that maſs of filthy matter,, which it carrieth out of the body, being made by its own venomous qualities, and ſo in former times was deemed <hi>more</hi> an Enemy, then a Friend in all its looſening Operations, as work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meerly by violence, and diſturbance of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that alſo much alike upon the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as upon the ſick, and ſo could not be ſaid to work upon the Diſeaſe directly, but at randome upon the body, and moſt often to its preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
            <p>Adviſing accordingly, that for diſcharging of Crudities (the cauſers of many Diſeaſes) recourſe ſhould be had to moderate Exerciſe and Recreation, rather then to Purgative Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. And that becauſe not only of their pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56217:10"/> their efficacy being contrary to Nature, and for the moſt part venomous, but alſo for that they are apt to root their poiſonous quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Body, and withall, divert and draw away from the Members thoſe kindly Juices which the powers of nature require for their nouriſhment and ſubſiſtance; Yea and the vital ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>its alſo which maintain and comfort life.</p>
            <p>Thus hath this looſening way of Phyſick been frequently condemned; But if this be not thought ſufficient to extinguiſh its unhappy uſe, let but every one concern'd refer to their own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and without partiality note, with what uncertainty theſe looſeners perform their Office: As ſometimes when but three or four ſtools are only expected, it gives eight, ten, nay twenty, and thoſe frequently, with ſo much lothing to the taſt, offenſive naſtineſs to the Noſtril, and to the Brain of patients and all about them, as alſo with ſuch extremity of pains and gripings as are moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, othertimes give never ſo many Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Pills, Powders. Electuaries of theſe looſening qualities, yet ſhall they not work at all to the terrour both of Phyſitian and Patient, yet other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles run out into ſuch looſneſſes as are never ſtayed, but with the death of the taker.</p>
            <p>And when working moſt kindly, and never ſo much ugly odd coloured ſtuff carried out, yet the Diſeaſe frequently not one jot abated, though the patient be thereby extreamly weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56217:10"/> ſcarce able to ſtand: The body alſo drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and robbed of almoſt all its Radical moiſture, much more apt to obſtinate obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and ſo neceſſarily calls for more of ſuch like miſerable helpers, which by frequent uſe perverts the beſt conſtitutions, ſow the ſeed of new Diſeaſes, and confounds the whole courſe of nature.</p>
            <p>And yet that this ſhould be continued in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual practice, upon ſo very many and great diſadvantages, perplexities and dangers meerly upon uncertainty, and be juſtified by the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, be the event never ſo ſad and Diſmal, this indeed is very myſterious, and too too like the myſtery of</p>
            <p>For who now adays remains in ſo much igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as not to know that Diſeaſe is a more lively, active thing, then to reſide amongſt ſuch muddy matter, as theſe Purgers can poſſibly reach, being indeed of a more ſprightly and and ſubtile Nature, then to be diſcovered by the Eye, Hand, or Knife of the moſt skilful Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, and only liable to the diſquiſition of Reaſon, and an ingenious, intimate conception; And ſo, not to be attempted by ſuch bluſterers, but by Medicines iſſuing from the ſame Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſuch as by their efficacious friendilneſs to Nature, with quietneſs and ſafety, Extinguiſh venoms, and enable her in all her faculties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the clear diſcharge of all diſtempers;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56217:11"/> And ſuch being to be had, as in the ſequel here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will evidently appear, one would think there were no need to perſwade either Phyſitians or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients to make an exchange where the differences of operation, and hopefulneſs of the Event, are ſo plainly manifeſt.</p>
            <p>Now, if Purging (as they call it) be thus ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly chargable with ſo many evils and miſchiefs, what can be ſaid in behalf of Vomiting the moſt Rugged, Churliſh, and cruel of Phyſick, tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and rending, and torturing, both Stomach, Bowels, Heart, Brain, Lungs, and Throat in ſo hidious a manner, as hardly any corporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment can be imagined to exceed it in pain and miſery.</p>
            <p>And yet though often reiterated, as it often befalls in many Diſtempers to intollerable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is never the leſs ſo uncertain in its Effects, as that no relief with any certainty can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed thereby, but fills diſtreſſed patients one while with fears when it worketh not, and when it worketh, with greater fears of working too much: There being ſad Examples of both, <hi>viz.</hi> where they have ſtayed in the body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any (expected) operation, and ſo deſtroyed the patient: And alſo where the working hath been ſo violent, and ſo continual, as hath never ceaſed, but with the Expiration of the ſick.</p>
            <p>And where theſe Extreams have not been, yet the failing of both men, women, and children is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56217:11"/> ſo frequently aſcribed to Vomits, that its won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful they are not Excluded quite out of uſe.</p>
            <p>Beſides, where Minerals are the main Agents in this unhappy work, it is incredible how miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous their preſent tortures, and after worſe than mortal inconveniencies have proved, convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and entailing moſt Horrid pains and diſtemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from Generation to Generation, to all Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity without hope of remedy; which though in proceſs of time are judged to proceed either from the Scurvy, or foul Diſeaſe, and to end in Conſumptions, or Kings Evil, yet driving the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry back to its Root, generally it hath been found, that the Original Cauſe hath much more juſtly belonged to unwholſome Purgers or Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miters taken in way of Phyſick.</p>
            <p>And when with their violence they have thrown up never ſo great a quantity of ugly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>opy or filthy ſtuff, which is often ſhewed to Patients, and friends, as if now the Diſeaſe muſt needs be wrought upon, and near its Extirpation, it tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proveth no more but the Venomous Nature of the Medicine; the Diſeaſe for the moſt part ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advancing than retreating, and receiving ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an addition of ſtrength, then any mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from ſuch miſchievous helpers.</p>
            <p>Seeing thus it generally is with Vomits; though ſometimes they may perform what may be taken for a good Office, yet ſince they do it not through any benignity in them, but by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56217:12"/> and the conſequence being certainly dangerous, why ſhould ſo troubleſome a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief-working-operation be longer retaind in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, or be impoſed as neceſſary upon diſtreſſed patients in time of ſickneſs? and not rather gladly remitted for ſuch truly vertuous Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, as through their powerful friendlineſs to Humane Nature, being taken into the body, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form with eaſe and ſafety, only, what the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſity of the body requireth: ſo as if the Diſeaſe be ſuch as requireth the emptying of the Stomach, throweth up, or carryeth downwards ſo much and no more but what is requiſite for promoting the moſt ſpeedy recovery, without any poſſibility of any after inconvenience, as hath been the conſtant prevalence of thoſe real Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines herein propoſed; And in Reaſon may well deſerve the ſerious thoughts of all ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons, before they are further engaged in ways ſo uncertain and dangerous, though of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo long continuance.</p>
            <p>The next preſcription in Phyſick, is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sweating, which is attempted, either with the vulgar Waters, Electuaries, or Powders, or elſe with Mineral Preparations, and had it not been for the known uncertainty and deficiency of the former, there had been no recourſe to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which inſtead of proving a ſure Refuge in time of need, hath generally treated the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with like adulation, as hers who cut the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56217:12"/> locks, or ſtruck a nail into the Temple, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly outſweating all the powers of Nature, or running madly out into ſalivation, or perpetual ſpetting, which are the ordinary Extravagant Effects of Quickſilver and Antimony, though under the moſt boaſted Preparations, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are ſo many ſad ſtories, as needs a Vail to cover their miſchievous treacheries, and are more then enough, if but a little hearkened after, to induce all rational perſons, for ever to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce both the giving and taking of them into their bodies upon any occaſion whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Yet if there be any, who nevertheleſs will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a confidence of the ſafety of their prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſee them take them themſelves before you take them, and then you have ſome aſſurance for your great adventure.</p>
            <p>But for me who deem it irrational, that any thing ſhould be given to the ſick which is not ſafe, and good for the healthful, and who am undoubtedly aſſured; that there are Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as ſecurely to be uſed in all Caſes as Milk to Children, which yet in the moſt deſperate Caſes, are full as ſpeedy and as certainly preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as ever was pretended from thoſe ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly hazardous and dangerous Minerals, and that too, with very little or no ſweating at all, but ever without Exhauſting the ſpirits, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or binding of the body, or any other after inconveniencies, having always in readineſs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56217:13"/> plenty of ſuch as theſe, and approved for ſuch by continual performances, I hope I may paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame, though I retain my judgment, and preſs thus earneſtly for an exchange, where the advantage to every one is ſo manifeſtly weighty and material.</p>
            <p>The nexr ſore troubler of the ſick, are Veſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories, or Raiſers of ſmall and great Bliſters, by irkſome fretting, if not venomous Plaiſters, ſomtimes flaying off all the skin from the backs, otherwhiles the ſhoulders, leggs, or wriſts, the neck, head, &amp;c. to extream torments, eſpecially when thoſe raw places are rub'd and irritated, for diverſion of venomous inflammations, hidious Curſes and Excrations having been noted the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient Effects of ſuch cruelties; of which Nature alſo are the uſe of Cupping Glaſſes, drawing of Silk through the Neck-skin, Leeches; and Iſſues, all full of pain, hazard, and danger; And as the Event proveth them, frequently fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as to the removal of any Diſtemper, ſo are they wholly needleſs, where real Medicines are in being, and muſt henceforth be accounted the more intollerable, ſince it is known ſo many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Cures have been performed without any ſuch tedious aſſiſtants, ſolely by ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
            <p>Then for cutting off the Hair, Capping and Plaiſtering the Head, they are all but trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Operations to the ſick, very ſeldom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56217:13"/> ſucceſsful, either in Conſumptions, or for removal of inveterate pains, for which ends they are moſt uſed, and with more advantage might be ſpared in liew of ſafe and powerful Medicines.</p>
            <p>And ſo alſo were it happy if Patients in like manner were rid of <hi>Opium,</hi> let what will be ſaid of its ſeveral Rectifications, for whether it be uſed in the <hi>Ladanum,</hi> or otherwiſe; the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent is oftentimes ſo ſuddenly, <hi>and ſo</hi> unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, and ſo unavoidably dangerous, that the knowledg of its aptneſs to miſcarry, as it hath done with divers, is more then enough to make every Diſpenſer of it to tremble, during the whole time it is in the Patients body. And therefore in reaſon ſhould gladly be left and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned for ever, having never ſince I have been furniſhed with the Medicines herein ſpecified, though in the moſt violent diſtempers, ſeen any occaſion for the uſe of ſo critical helpers, that inſtead of reſt and ſleep, like treacherous flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, ſtroak, and ſtab, and give Death it ſelf in the ſame inſtant, to the horror and amazement both of Phyſitians and bewailing relations.</p>
            <p>Which by truly good and real Medicines, might be ſafely avoided, ſuch by their efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous prevalence againſt the venom of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in ſhort time, not failing to introduce an unenforced well proportioned ſleep, not only void of all poſſibility of danger, but without
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56217:14"/> ſickiſhneſs upon waking, afrer-dotages weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Nerves, or any diſpiriting of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Faculties, Palſies, Vertigoes, Apoplexies, the frequent Iſſues of opumated Medicines.</p>
            <p>And therefore though I am far from wiſhing ſo much evil to the Practiſers with <hi>Opium,</hi> that every of them ſhould be obliged to take the ſame quantity which at any time they preſcribe: (which yet is one of the Rules I always bind my ſelf to in whatſoever I adviſe) yet I do heartily wiſh, that the whole Old Method of Phyſick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned in all the particulars of <hi>Gliſters, Bleedings, Purgings, Vomitings, Sweatings, by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, Iſſues, Cuppings, Bliſterings,</hi> &amp;c. were all ſo well and throughly opiated, ſtupified, and laid aſleep for ever, that they might never more riſe again in Reputation with Phyſicians, or ever more be readmitted by diſtreſſed Patients.</p>
            <p>But that both out of a moſt powerful ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity which moſt good Conſciences are full fraught withall; And out of a deep ſenſe of the manifold miſchiefs incident to that way, would freely and fully forſake them all; and exchange them for the uſe of ſuch true, and real Helpers, as are known to perform the utmoſt in all Caſes that can be expected from Medicine; and that with ſo much mildneſs and ſafety, as diſturbs not, nor hazards <hi>the weakeſt</hi> in their Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

A truly benign Medicine, fit for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Humane Nature ought to be liquid, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently clear, pure and pleaſant: (for reaſons expreſſed in my touchſtone of Phyſick) ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, as to ſubdue the moſt violent Diſtempers, and yet ſo mild, as the weakeſt women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may partake thereof in any caſe without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard: And for aſſurance, the Preſcriber is to take the ſame quantity he gives upon any occaſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All ſuch kindly and real Medicines ought to be ſo qualified, that if taken by Men, Women, or Children, in Health, ſhall no ways move their bodies, but nouriſh and cheriſh them. But if by any in ſickneſs, the ſame quantity from their effectual friendlineſs to humane Nature in due time, ſhall either binde or looſen, vomit, or ſtay vomiting; ſweat, or reſtrain exceſſive ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, give reſt in caſe of reſtleſneſs, or with-hold from immoderate ſleep, as the inſtant neceſſity of the body needeth, or as conduceth moſt to Recovery.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And laſtly, They ought to be no periſhable Commodities, which prove but weak and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective helpers, but ſuch as cloſe ſtopt keep good for years in all Climates without any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of their vertues, never failing or decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56217:15"/> upon their hands, who furniſheth themſelves therewith, either for Sea or Land, or that rely and depend upon them for relief in any their occaſions or neceſſities.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Marks which are ſufficient for proof of the fitneſs or unfitneſs of all Medicines whatſoever; and for detection of all ſuch as may, and no doubt will be counterfeiting of theſe, or at leaſt ſome of them, as ſoon as they grow into any Eſtimation, and are called for by the ſick; Then who that practiſes will be without ſome ſuch ſpiritful preparation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, that ſo it may be thought they are not wanting in any thing for their recovery; &amp; well it were if it were ſo indeed: But being really ſuch, they are then not to moleſt their Patients, either with Purgings, Vomitings, Bleedings, Iſſues, Gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Bliſters, nor with any thing of Antimony, Quickſilver, or Opium, there being no need of ſuch hazardous and dangerous operations or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perators, but are all totally to be abandoned where there are Medicines of thoſe abſolute Marks and Qualifications; ſo as if in the leaſt they tamper one while with a Gliſter, another<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while with a Purge or a Vomit, &amp;c. though now and then they ſhould give a Doſe, reſembling ſuch as theſe, it ſignifies juſt nothing, but that they would ſeem to have as much as any, when at the ſame time, it is manifeſt they themſelves have no confidence therein, nor no dependence
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56217:15"/> thereupon, but according to their old Mode, are fain on all occaſions to have recourſe to their old perplexed medlyes; therefore its good to be wary, and to note all ſuch Counterfeitters of Medicines, as but Counterfeit Practiſers, more mindful of their own reputations, then of the recovery of their Patients: the Marks are few, eaſy to be minded, and to be applyed whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, or by whomſoever any Medicines are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented and preſcribed, and in reaſon ſhould ſway in every ones Election or rejection accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
            <p>Or however for my ſelf, I ſhall never be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to acknowledge, that it is to theſe Marks ſolely that I have confined all my Medicines: And that for this way; This untrodden Path in Phyſick, ſo acquired as I have expreſſed, I have forſaken, and abandoned all the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and dangerous courſes, Materials, Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Practiſes forementioned; and ſtill ſee good cauſe to bleſs God that ever I was Enabled to make ſo happy an Exchange, for the benefit of mankind; at leaſt to ſo many as the difference of thoſe two wayes, ſhall come to be ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and throughly conſidered. A difference ſo great, the one bringing abundant troubles, pains, hazards and dangers, and attended with weepings, woes and lamentations: the other with qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, eaſe, ſafety, hopefulneſs and chearfulneſs: ſo that the profit of this Exchange in it ſelf rightly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56217:16"/> underſtood, cannot but appear ineſtimable and unexpreſſible, yet ſo hardly (with many) are old ways left though never ſo painful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed; Or new ways embraced, though never ſo ſafe, eaſeful and free from all diſturbance (the averſneſs being generally whetted by ſome ſiniſter intereſt) that without perpetual inſiſting in a full diſcovery of the Advantages and diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, there would be no hope of Prevailing for ſuch a condeſcenſion as in this weighty Cauſe is agreeable to Truth and Reaſon.</p>
            <p>But all things have their ſeaſon; Evangelical Doctrine bringing nothing but peace, though long oppoſed by the Legal, which brought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but terrour to the ſin-ſick Conſcience, yet in time as truth prevailed, became clearly victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, both over the Law, and their Intereſt that would maintain it: And ſo in time I doubt not, but it may alſo prove in this, as the difference once comes to be rightly underſtood; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Cuſtom and Intereſt may have ſo prevailed &amp; enchained mens minds, as almoſt in every ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to reckon no other, but that there is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of undergoing all thoſe painful, cruel, danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and miſchievous practiſes and proceedings afore recited; yet certainly when they ſhall be ſerious in their thoughts, and plainly ſee that there is another way in Phyſick Eſtabliſhed upon more ſure Foundations and Principles, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Medicines ariſing from theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56217:16"/> which cure with much more certainty, and yet wholly exempt from all terrours, pains, and dangers, and that may by every one be known to be ſuch by Evident Marks and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and by abundant Inſtances of Cures per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſolely by ſuch Medicines, as in the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of Phyſick plentifully appeareth: There will then certainly be no place for oppoſition, nor need of farther Arguments to perſwade their chearful Entertainment, nor to doubt a general adherence to their aſſiſtance, <hi>by all Perſons and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</hi>

               <p>Theſe are the Medicines which upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions I have found abundatly ſufficient for all the Ends and Intentions of Phyſick, ſo that whoſoever ſhall throughly acquaint themſelves therewith, and furniſh themſelves with due quantities thereof, may not only eaſily and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly and ſtrength and vigour to their uſual Diet, plenteouſly repleniſh their continual waſt and Expence of Spirits, daily refreſh themſelves with real advantage to their health; Supply all ſuddain Illneſs or Exigencies, without all fear of after Inconveniencies; but are thereby firmly enabled, with Gods bleſſing, to grapple
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56217:21"/> with, and ſubdue the moſt violent and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate diſeaſes whatſoever, which make up the full ſcope of all Phyſical knowledge, and Medicinal performances.</p>
               <p>And all theſe without any the hazards or dangers forementioned; Are alike uſeful at all times and and ſeaſons of the year, <hi>Winter, Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Spring,</hi> or <hi>Autumn;</hi> ſafely and pleaſantly to be taken by all perſons in all ſtates of health, or degrees of weakneſs from the very Cradle to Oldeſt Age, without any confinement to houſe, or Chamber (except in caſes of Extremity,) without charge of viſits, or tedious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and with all poſſible quietneſs and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to the Patient.</p>
               <p>All which are no ſeigned Deluſions, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Truths, as divers who have long time ſolely depended on their aſſiſtance, both for themſelves and Families, with abſolute good ſucceſs can ſufficiently teſtifie, reckoning withall, that all circumſtances duly conſidered, they are not the deareſt, but the cheapeſt of Phyſick.</p>
               <p>Beſides as never any harm could juſtly be imputed to any of them; ſo were they never known to fail of Cure, where time proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the conſtitution of the body, and to the quality and degree of the Diſtemper, hath been allowed, and Directions followed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p>But where Diſtemper hath taken faſt hold
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56217:21"/> upon a body over worn with toyl, care, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, aggravated by omiſſion of timely medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and then tyred out, nay confounded with intricate and unwholeſome Phyſick; and from one ſort of Medicine to another, until the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines have proved more miſchievous, and more inveterate then the firſt Diſeaſe; for Patients in ſuch difficult Caſes as theſe, to think a moneths time (or ſo) ſufficient for recovery, failing of their hopes, rather taxes their own reaſon, then the validity of the Medicines.</p>
               <p>And yet even in ſuch forlorn undertakings, I have in very few days ſeen ſo great and ſo good an alteration, that had it not been deſtroyed by too much preſuming thereupon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by taking cold anew, and ſo looſing all that was gained; There was ſufficient to give aſſurance that time and perſeverance in their plenteous uſe would have perfected their work; all after deviations from this courſe of Phyſick, and theſe Medicines never bringing the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſo good a condition; Nor did I ever know them laid aſide for any others, but there was cauſe to wiſh they had not left them: But if ever it is in ſuch caſes as theſe, that this ſaying is verified, That there are ſome <hi>who will be ſick too late,</hi> and <hi>well too ſoon:</hi> And makes me think of divers unhappy Patients, when I mind that ſaying, <hi>He found no ſteadfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, no not in his Angels.</hi> Very few in inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56217:22"/> caſes being apt upon utmoſt perſwaſive ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to give a tenth part of time requiſite; or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reſolved to do it, that wil be conſtant for half the time; And this not always from an inſtabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Patient, but moſt unhappily from the odd officious Medlings of Viſitants and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who though wholly void of true judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Phyſick, or in the differences between what is, and what is not to be truſted to, are ever cenſuring the preſent proceedings, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing one while this, another while that, boaſting up this, and commending another, as having ſpeedily cured divers in like caſes with very ſmall charge.</p>
               <p>A ſort of friendſhip might very well be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſhould a little more then it doth touch the Conſciences of all ſuch well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſturbers, if not deſtroyers of theſe whom yet with all their hearts they earneſtly deſire ſhould be preſerved, affectionate and zealous: errors being always moſt miſchievous.</p>
               <p>For my part, I can clearly affirm, that I never gave the ſmalleſt quantity of thoſe my Medicines to any perſon, in any caſe, but I heartily wiſht it might prove a perfect Cure; And it is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute truth, that very many in a year have been cured of ſuch Diſtempers, ſome for the value of 6 d. ſome 12 d. and ſometimes a very little more, that probably in any other way, could not have eſcaped a tedious fit of ſickneſs, or a chargable
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56217:22"/> courſe of Phyſick, and I am never more joyed then when it is ſo.</p>
               <p>Yet this doth not argue that every one that falls ill ſhould expect always the like ſucceſs, there being ſo vaſt a difference in Conſtitutions, and in the nature of Diſeaſes, in neglect of the inſtant uſe of means, and a while deferring as alters the Caſe beyond imagination, and which unavoidably enforces as great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the difficulty and time of recovery.</p>
               <p>But then, how Exceedingly much more doth the Caſe differ when the Diſeaſe hath been of many years continuance, and ſo many various Phyſicks uſed time after time, that it is very preſumable ſome of it may have been veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and infinitely added to the malice of the Diſeaſe: Though in ſuch Caſe I ſhould not deſpair of prevailing, in this way of ſafe and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Medicines; yet I ſhould blame my ſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively ſhould I give any hope of ſucceſs, but upon an abſolute promiſe from ſuch patients of perſeverance for at leaſt ſo many Moneths, if not twice the number, as they have been <hi>years</hi> affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and admit the charge of ſuch a condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſhould amount to 10, nay 20 Crowns a moneth, which I ſuppoſe would be the moſt, what a ſmall thing were this to perſons of means and quality, to adventure in a courſe ſo ſafe, and withal ſo hopeful, and after hundreds, if not thouſands of pounds ſpent in vain, in ways
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56217:23"/> neither ſo ſafe nor rational, and in ſuch hands as I am ſure to gain the world, would not defer a Cure one moment; <hi>That Inſtance in the Touch-ſtone of Phyſick,</hi> Of the Gentlwoman that was left hopeleſs by all her Phyſitians, after a long time of uſing their utmoſt Endeavours, and ſhe brought to nothing but skin and bones, and her Diſeaſe triumphing over her weakneſs, when her ſad Husband came to me, deſiring my aſſiſtance, had he ſcrupulouſly enquired whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had ever cured any one in ſo hopeleſs a condition, or endeavoured to have confined me to time, or been ſolicitous in what time I thought ſome hopes might appear, or where about the charge of her Cure might be; It is very like I had never undertaken her, as abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing more then ſuch huckſtering in caſes of ſickneſs where there is ability: But he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all wholly to me, though by reaſon of ſome relapſe, it was ſome moneths before ſhe went abroad, yet both he and ſhe were fully ſatisfied with all that was done, and God bleſt it to her wonderful recovery. All which I have thus Expreſſed, if poſſible to make all perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd ſenſible how great a difference there may be in Diſtempers, ſeemingly alike, and how much more time may be requiſite for recovery of one more then another; And to work them to a willing reſignation of themſelves, to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they ſhall think meet to truſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56217:23"/> ſcruple, or repining either at Time or Charge, ſtedfaſtly to perſevree, eſpecially being engaged in a way ſo ſafe, and with Medicines ſo kindly, and withal ſo powerful (as here are ſolely intended) and, which by the Marks fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going may eaſily be tryed and proved, whether they are ſo or not; but being ſuch, there is all Encouragement imaginable to perſiſt with hope and chearfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Withal, the Patient muſt be ſure, both in his Diet, and ſhunning all hazards, to be helpful to his Phyſitian, and moſt careful to obſerve all Directions, Cautions and Circumſtances advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that being the only way to make the beſt of what is taken, and to keep and not looſe the ſmalleſt degree of improvement obtained; for thoſe who get and keep ground, though but by inches, are ſure in the end of victory.</p>
               <p>But without reſolving to perſiſt in their uſe, (whether they are governed by Patients them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or their relations on their behalf, or by Phyſitians) I would not encourage any to begin with any of theſe Medicines; It being my man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner always to refuſe the undertaking of any that I either doubt, or will not promiſe to perſevere with them, and ſtrictly to adhere to Directions; upon which being reſolved, none need to fear ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, Anſwerable either to the Inſtances menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the <hi>Touch-ſtone of Phyſick,</hi> or to thoſe <hi>Cures</hi> ſince performed by them.</p>

            <head>Some whereof to manifeſt that they are ſtill the ſame both in Efficacy, and in Performance, I ſhall here recite as followeth.</head>
            <p n="1">1. A Gentleman about thirty years of age, upon an Extream cold taken with great pains over all his body, Headake, and ſtoppage at his ſtomack, I ſent him 3 ounces of <hi>Vindex naturae,</hi> to be taken a little warm'd laſt at night, which quit him perfectly of his Diſtemper.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Boy about 3 years old taken in ſo ſtupid a manner, as thoſe who are ſaid to be ſtruck with Death, as the Parents verily thought this Child; Being ſomewhat far from me, they made uſe at firſt of ſome other means, but being worſe upon it, they ſent to me, I ſent him a ſmall quantity of <hi>Radix,</hi> to be given by a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful every hour, and 2 ounces of <hi>Salus</hi> for the night, to be taken a little warm at twice, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for divers days and nights, with no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of prevailing in the leaſt, yet depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſolely upon theſe Medicines, they ſent to me daily; much and often they ſolicited me to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Gliſter, which I durſt not admit, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity being ſo obſtinate, beſides the child had ordinary ſtools daily; at length I ordered 3 ounces of <hi>Athleta naturae:</hi> Upon which there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed two or three ſharp and looſe ſtools, whereupon he became perfectly well.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Brother of this Child ſome 2 yeas older, was ſoon after taken very ill alſo, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56217:24"/> Feveriſh, but being inſtantly ſent to, I ordered him 3 ounces of <hi>Vindex,</hi> which proved to his abſolute recovery: In all which Caſes, or the like, where thirſt moleſteth or is feared, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appont White-wine Poſſet-drink to be freely taken, made with a quarter of a pint of White-wine to a quart of Milk (and not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in Wine) and to uſe no other Drink, if they can be ſo perſwaded, but if not, then once in four or ſix hours to admit a draught of 8 ſhillings Beer with Sugar and a Toaſt, which I deſire may be noted as a general Rule, and not to be ſcrupled.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A young woman layn in, and well almoſt to the end of her moneth, upon a ſudden had no paſſage for her water; upon which I was ſent to, her condition being very much feared, I ſent her half a pint of <hi>Vis vitae,</hi> which being given her at twice warmed, within 3 hours time, ſhe became perfectly well.</p>
            <p n="5">One almoſt 70 years of age, having contracted ſome foulneſs of ſtomack, and ſlimineſs in the Uriters, was unexpectedly taken with ſtoppage of water; which he bore awhile as hopeing it might alter of it ſelf, being not much provoked nor pained, ſo eat and drank as uſual; ſoon after, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king trial he found the ſtoppage to continue, and withal an unuſual aptneſs to Vomit, which he gave way unto, and brought up abundance without pain, which being ended, I ordered
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56217:25"/> him to drink a quarter of a pint of <hi>Stella vitae;</hi> which he did at one draught, half an hour after, though otherwiſe well, yet ſtill his water ſtaid, wherupon I order'd him totake a quarter of a pint of <hi>Vis vitae</hi> well warm'd, which he drank off at one draught, and ſo laid him down upon his bed, where he ſlept ſo ſoundy for two full hours, that when he wak't, he thought it had been but half an hour, and then trying to make water, it freely iſſued as at other times, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him no more.</p>
            <p n="6">6. An Elderly Gentleman frequently and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently troubled with Gripings, Wind and Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, uſing much means in Phyſick, being by his Phyſitian allowed the uſe of <hi>Vis vitae,</hi> which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally he keeps by him always in readineſs, never fails of certain relief thereby.</p>
            <p n="7">7. His Wife generally troubled with Wind, and weakneſs of Stomack, having recourſe upon all occaſions to the uſe of <hi>Sanguis vitae,</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders her life very ſecure and comfortable.</p>
            <p n="8">8. A Gentleman ſufficiently able to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of Phyſick, being in <hi>London,</hi> his Wife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Extreamly ill far off in the Country through a long crazed body, and then afflicted with intollerable pains all over, with debility of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, and all faculties, applyed himſelf with very anxious ſolicitation to me, as dreading her immediate loſs; ſo conſulting together, we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to ſend her a quart of <hi>Radix vitae</hi> to take
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56217:25"/> of in it continually, a little and little day and night, which being taken, he received and brought me very joyful tidings of her happy recovery.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Awhile after the ſame Gentleman deſired my advice for a Gentlewoman, quite ſtuffed up with Flegm, and oppreſſed with an Extream Cough, and defect of Appetite; upon a little diſcourſe we agreed ſhe ſhould have a pint of <hi>Radix,</hi> to take a little and little all the day, and at bedtime 6 ſpoonfuls, and in the night a liitle and little as ſhe ſound occaſion, which through Gods goodneſs perfectly recovered her.</p>
            <p n="10">10. A Gentleman about 30, highly Feveriſh with Vomiting, Thirſt, and Headake, and ſore all over his body; I ſent him 3 ounces of <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi> to be taken at Bedtime, and to drink White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine Poſſet made as afore is mentioned; this he took, and next morning was much mended, and omitted to take any thing all that day, but the day following I ſaw cauſe to ſend him 6 ounces of <hi>Lac vitae</hi> to take by ſips all that day, and 3 ounces of <hi>Vindex</hi> for bedtime, which enabled him next day to come himſelf and give me thanks for ſo happy an alteration with ſo little trouble and coſt.</p>
            <p n="11">11. A Gentleman about 35, going out of <hi>London</hi> not very well, &amp; far off in the Country, oppreſſed with perpetual buſineſs even night and day, his Body alſo being not of the firmeſt Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56217:26"/> fell into ſo Extream a Fever, and ſo confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly ill all over, that to preſerve himſelf, he was forced to make uſe of ſuch Helps and Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in Phyſick as the place afforded, which was not deſpicable, yet availed nothing, upon which his Friends by his Order ſends to me his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deſiring me to ſend what I thought fit (for he was well acquainted with my Medicines, and uſed never to travel without full quantities of them) ſo I ſent him a quart of <hi>Radix,</hi> and a pint of <hi>Vindex naturae:</hi> But ſo obſtinate a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper was hardly ever heard of, for though he had after this much more and larger quantities of <hi>Radix,</hi> and of <hi>Vindex, Athleta, Lumen naturae,</hi> and <hi>Vis vitae,</hi> and <hi>Salus vitae,</hi> all which he took always with very much aſſurance of goo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>et by one occaſion or other he was ſo often even upon the point of Death, that I became afraid to open the Letters that came from his Diſconſolate friends. How it came to be thus, I could not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly learn, though ſome imputed it to diverſity of advice, &amp; proceedings of Phyſitians or Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions near him, which unnoted by him, or his deareſt Friends, might perplex &amp; nullifie the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe Medicines: Nevertheleſs by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees he gaind ſo much ſtrength, or rather ſo much courage, as to reſolve for <hi>London,</hi> where with difficulty he arrived: But his reſidence being near to a Phyſitian his friend, and being then on the ſuddain Extream ill, he fell into the general
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56217:26"/> courſe of Phyſick which held a long time, and had very various ſucceſſes, very much through a ſtrange unchect liberty he took in Diet, helping himſelf notwithſtanding now and then with a large Bottle of <hi>Radex,</hi> and at length got ſo much ſtrength, as to adventure to refreſh himſelf in the Country: But withal depending ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Medicines, that he cauſed to be ſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after him, 7 pints of <hi>Vis vitae,</hi> and 2 pints more, before he came back, and through mercy returned, ſo well as to purſue his occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and which hath not ſince failed him, and ſeems ſtill to have as high, if not a more high E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of theſe Medicines; and I believe he hath good cauſe for it, or he would not as he ſince hath done, commended their uſe to his beſt Friends in all their occaſions. And I conceive under God aſcribes unto them very much of his preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: It being alſo very preſumable his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very had been far ſooner, and more perfect, had he not been diverted, but ſolely depended on their aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p n="12">12. A young Lad taken ſuddenly ſo Extream ill and Feveriſh, that the Mother knowing his weak nature doubted he could not live, twice two ounces of <hi>Vindex</hi> for two nights given him, prov'd to his recovery.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The ſame Lad a while after fell into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſtemper lying continually in a ſenſeleſs ſtupid condition, I gave him 2 ounces of <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:56217:27"/> mixt with half an ounce of <hi>Ignis vitae</hi> for one night, and the like for next night, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured him.</p>
            <p n="14">14. A young Gentlewoman always upon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king cold, and preternatural ſtoppages, Extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted with ſharp violent pains all over her body, but more eſpecially in her head, never fail'd of recovery by the uſe of <hi>Radix vitae,</hi> in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to the quantity of half a pint taken by little and little, and by ſix ounces of <hi>Vita naturae,</hi> taken by two ounces a night, for three nights toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="15">15. A young Boy far off in the Country, being accuſtomed to Extream fits of Crying, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man related to the Family noting how he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed his body at ſuch times, told the Parents he was perſwaded the Child was troubled about the paſſage of his Water, and being well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my Medicines, adviſed the uſe of <hi>Vis vitae,</hi> which being given day and night by little and little, perfectly cured him, wherein they uſed about three pints, or two quarts at moſt, which was no great coſt for perſons of Quality.</p>
            <p n="16">16. A youth about ſeventeen, ſtrong and healthful, upon a ſuddain, without any mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt cauſe, became Extreamly ill, with violent pains in his head, ſickiſhneſs at his ſtomack, ſore all over his body, with ſome Giddineſs; it was a time when the Small Pox was very rife;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56217:27"/> but he having had them, and my advice inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, I thought it beſt to arm, as if it might prove the Peſtilence, and ſo gave him three ounces of <hi>Vindex,</hi> and a good quantity of <hi>Radix</hi> to uſe little and little, refreſhing himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with continually: But for all this a Vomiting ſeaſed him with Extream thirſt and reſtleſsneſs, and binding of his body, I wiſht his Kinred might be acquainted how he was, and to reſolve what courſe to take: But it fell out, the principal of them (within reach) underſtood my way, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſiring I would proceed, upon which I plyed him continually with <hi>Salus vitae,</hi> till at length the Small Pox plentifully appears, and being ordered accordingly with due care, he ſoon began to feel his ſtomack and ſtrength ſo far, that he preſumed one morning to riſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a fire in his Chamber, or warming any of his Clothes, unknown to any body: This ſtruck him down, and the Wheals began to grow flat; Then his Friend who had the chief care of him, being tome to Town, he began to be troubled that he was under an unuſual Courſe of Phyſick, ordering one of his own acquaintance to take the charge of him: But this the youth refuſed, as being ſatisfied with the way he was in, and ſo was the Phyſitian to whoſe care he was referred which was ſomewhat rare: So I fell to work a freſh with <hi>Vindex, Salus, Radix,</hi> and the like, and in ſhort time, recovered him to ſo much
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56217:28"/> ſtrength, as made him ſo fond therewith, that one of his Familiars coming to viſit him out of mirth and ſportfulneſs, he urged him to ſing with him ſome merry Catch, but the party diſliking ſo ſimple a motion, fell into more ſeriouſneſs with him, that he was but newly eſcaped from as dangerous a Sickneſs as ever any did: that though he were ſure the worſt was paſt, as for his part, he as yet was not, other thoughts would better become him: But to deal plainly with you, ſaid he, what ever you think, there may be but a ſtep betwixt you and Death, and therefore it is fit you better prepare your ſelf: But this well meant advice wrought ſo much farther then he intended, that it had like indeed to have coſt him his life, making ſo deep an impreſſion, that there was no perſwaſion of any poſſibility of life, ſo that I was forced to redouble my Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, and others to convince him, that there was no fear of his preſent Diſtemper: And that now he had nothing to trouble his thoughts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but how to be thankful to God, and walk worthy of ſo great a Deliverance: which at length cured and reſtored him: But may ſerve for Caution, not to lay too much weight upon weak minds in times of ſickneſs, nothing being more killing then the affright of Death.</p>
            <p n="17">17. No ſooner was he recovered, but the maid that attended him throughout his ſickneſs, fell Extreamly ill, highly Feveriſh with intollerable

            <p n="18">18. A Gentleman about 30. taken with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pains in his left ſide, with ſtoppage of his breath, and thereby in ſuch Extremity that he could hardly ſpeak, and then crying out he muſt either bleed or die: Yet when Bleeding hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him no relief, or ſo little, that his miſery hath ſoon returned upon him: A quarter of a pint of <hi>Vindex</hi> hath clearly diſcharged the fit: And when in proceſs of time he hath been troubled again in like manner, he hath found ſpeedy reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by a quarter of a pint of <hi>Stella,</hi> or at moſt half a pint: Other times by as much of <hi>Refugium,</hi> for he hath often been ſo afflicted, yet could never be induced to condeſcend to any courſe for root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the cauſe of the Diſtemper: And that becauſe he found theſe remedies ſo certain: Now theſe being Pleuretick Diſtempers, and which are not only accompanied with violent pains and heat, and paſs not off but with the avoidance of an abundance of thick Flegm, it would amaze an ordinary Artiſt, that Medicines ſo hot as theſe could be ſo proper, and ſo ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as theſe have proved in ſuch Caſes, and which they often object to diſſwade their uſe: But as their Objections proceed from want of a due diſtinction between Vertuous and Vitious heats,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56217:29"/> ſo hath their conſtant good ſucceſs baffled their Objections, the Patient being not to be ſtartled from what gives him moſt ſure and certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, for their Groundleſs, if not partial coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Another Gentleman about 30. Extreamly afflicted with a quartane Ague, to quit himſelf whereof, he had run the whole courſe of Phyſick, but all in vain, his cold fits being very turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and tedious, &amp; his hot more long and irkſom, being accompanied with intollerable thirſt, and followed with ſuch vehement Sweatings, as if he had been in a boyling Bath, which ſweatings with ſickiſhneſs, alſo continued as much upon his well nights, as upon his ill: And being much engaged in buſineſs which required his being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, he was ful of anxious thoughts what to do for relief. When one who had good experience of my way, recommended him to me, ſo I gave him when he came unto me a draught of <hi>Sanguis</hi> well heated, and a quarter of a pint of <hi>Vindex</hi> for his Fit, which taking twice and not finding reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy he withdrew his hopes, and it being not my manner to preſs any beyond their own minds, our Proceedings ceaſt for above a week, he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening to his former Councel, being poſſeſt, that if any thing carried off the Cauſe of ſo great diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it muſt be Purging and Vomiting Phyſick which rowſing all parts of the body, and void<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great a maſs of ugly coloured and naſty
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56217:29"/> filth, the Ague or what ever it be muſt needs out at laſt: Arguments indeed, with cuſtome of knowing no better, ſo powerful as deceives both the Learned and unlearned parts of the whole World, and therefore no marvel if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this our perplexed Patient as long as he could ſtand, or till he was almoſt off of his legs: But at length wearied and tired out, Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing again with his friend, he told him he was to blame to Deſiſt from my way ſo ſoon, that he was certain it was a ſure way, and if followed would not fail: Why ſays he, why did he not tell me ſo then? He did, ſays his friend, and I told you ſo too, but you regarded it not, beſides ſays he, you are to urge him to do his utmoſt, and to ſpare for no coſt, if you mean to be cured, and not to expect that he ſhould preſs you; that having ſuch a ſhew of ſelf reſpect, as is abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by all ingenious Artiſts: Upon this he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to me again, and Earneſtly deſires me to do my utmoſt for him, that he would with all his heart give twenty pounds to be cur'd of his Diſtemper. Whereupon I fell to work amain, giving him <hi>Radix</hi> to carry always about him, and to drink it in good quantity continually; Alſo to take every night at reſting time 4 ounces of <hi>Salus,</hi> and not to riſe too ſoon in the morning: Then for his fit he was to take a quarter of a pint of <hi>Vindex,</hi> either a little before, or juſt upon its entrance: And in his hot fit to ſip con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56217:30"/> of <hi>Salus vitae:</hi> And if thirſt enforced, to relieve by White-wine Poſſet, or now and then with Table Beer, and toſt &amp; Sugar; ſo purſuing this courſe for about ten Days, the whole work was finiſhed, and he perfectly recovered; And this without ſpending much more of his twenty pounds, then fifty ſhillings, ſo far have I ever been from putting any to farther charge, than meerly neceſſary, though it be very much to my Encouragement to have the whole in all reſpects wholly referred to me; Nor with me ſhall any over ſpeed the worſe for ſo doing, nor is any thing more improper or abſurd, than in ſickneſs either to ſtarve their Cauſe, or to truſt to halves.</p>
            <p>But though this Gentlemans Ague were quite diſcharged, and Strength and Stomack reſtored, and all faculties in Due State and good Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Yet being performed without Purging, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, Bleeding, Iſſues, or Bliſters, or Sweaters (Except ſuch as reſtrain'd and put an end to his moſt violent ſweating) this ſeem'd ſo ſtrange a Myſtery to thoſe in whoſe hands he had been, that they told him the work was but falacious, &amp; could not be perfect, but would either return upon him, or bring him into ſome more dangerous Diſtemper, and this he would certainly find, if he did not ſpeedily take ſome fit Purgative to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry off the Relicks; Now though this ſomewhat prevail'd with him (as it doth upon moſt) yet
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56217:30"/> he would be ſo ingenious, as to tell me what was ſaid before he would take any thing: I told him they were ſo accuſtomed to that courſe, that it was no wonder they thought it neceſſary: But for him that had ſeen the Impotence of their Purges, and Vomiters, as to the ſubduing of his Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and the powerfulneſs of thoſe Medicines that did ſubdue it, for him to doubt that which had performed ſo far above his hope, and upon which he found himſelf ſo compleatly well, would leave Relicks that muſt want the help of ſuch naſty miſerable helpers, ſhould give the leaſt Ear, or yield in the leaſt thereto, would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue him a fit Subject to be play'd upon by every trifler, and never more to be aſſiſted by ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne Medicines, as when they had done his work, muſt be made liable to ſo abominable Diſparagement. Upon this he ſeem'd fully for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified againſt their charming; And when next they undertook him, and in reply (to what he urged from my Diſcourſe) ſaid they did allow the Ague was ſubdued and kill'd: But ſay they, admit you kill a Dogg in your houſe, if you let him lie there, and not quickly throw him out, hee'l ſoon make you weary of your Habitation; <hi>Ergo,</hi> If you throw not your Dead Dogg out, you muſt look to quit your houſe afore ye are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware. And this frighted him again to me with a witneſs; I ſmil'd to hear this Syllogiſtical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, &amp; putting out a Candle that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56217:31"/> us, I ask't him where was the flame, he ſaid it was Exſtinguiſh't, I askt him whether there were any Danger to be feared from it; he ſaid no; I ask't him why? he ſaid, becauſe it was Extinguiſh't: I told him ſo it was with his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, the Venom which cauſed all his various Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances being alſo Extinguiſhed by the Vertue &amp; Efficacy of the benign and powerful Medicines he had taken, whoſe good qualities were ſuch, as to leave nothing behind, but what they put Nature into an ability to Evacuate: And this ſatisfied him; and it was well it did; for though it be the common Courſe, and frequently paſſeth without manifeſt prejudice, yet as here it was wholly needleſs, ſo hath it ſometimes proved ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly pernicious: For,</p>
            <p n="20">20. A Child being very ſtrangely ill, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents not knowing what to do, the Mother ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing with me, I gave her two ounces of <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex,</hi> becauſe, whether it might prove the Meaſels, Small-pox, Fever, Peſtilence, or Ague, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine was very proper. This being given to the Child by a ſpoonful every half hour: The next Day the Small-pox appeared, after which being plyed with <hi>Salus</hi> now and then half a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, they came out full, ripened, ſhaled off kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Child perfectly well, very much to the joy of the Parents: But Neighbours and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitants, and Kindred were not ſo ſatisfied, and by all means the Child muſt be Purged, or one
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56217:31"/> Evil or other would certainly attend him, which at length the Parents yielded to, ſo the Child was purged as they will needs ſtill call it, and very well upon it for a while, but ſoon after was taken with ſuch ſtrange fits, as he was then thought to be bewitcht, and was very like to have coſt his life: So here the imaginary Dead Dogg was changed for a real tearing Bear, that through its Venomous Nature tortured and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Child even to Death: And yet this, nor any reaſon or Argument will prevail, but let one recover either out of Peſtilence, Fever, Ague, Small-pox, Meazels or Surfet, the firſt thing is thought on, oh by all means, the relicks of the Diſtemper muſt be caſt off by ſome gentle Purge, or miſchief follows, yea if ever the party be ill again, it ſhall be ſure to be aſcribed to the want of Purging after ſuch or ſuch a ſickneſs: In ſuch ſimple bondage both the weak and wiſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main even in this inquiſitive generation. In ſo much that two young ones by help of <hi>Salus vitae,</hi> lately well recovered from the Small Pox: The perſon concerned in them, told me he was ſo pelted by ſome of his Phyſical neighbours to Purge them, that though it went againſt his own reaſon, yet he could have no quiet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: So to be ſure from after claps, between them he gave laſt at night 3 ounces of <hi>Salus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae,</hi> to which under God, their ſo ſpeedy recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was juſtly to be aſcribed: And which is not

            <p n="21">21. A Gentleman about 35. by over much toyling, travelling, and puthering in buſineſs, not only for himſelf, which had been more then enough, but for help of others involved in troubles; brought himſelf (by ill and Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Diet, and many times unwholſome Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) into ſo ill a habit of body, that at length wrought it ſelf into a moſt violent ſickneſs and inflammation, which he ſought to remedy by the beſt of means and counſel he could get, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he continued ſo long, till his fleſh, and ſtrength, and ſtomack, utterly failed, whil'ſt his Diſtemper inſtead of abating, heightened, and increaſed upon him, ſo that what further to do he knew not: In this ſad condition he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to me about the beginning of Winter.</p>
            <p>The firſt I gave him was a quarter of a pint of <hi>Stella vitae</hi> a little warm, which he drank at one Draught, and about a quarter of an hour after, the ſame quantity of <hi>Vis vitae</hi> well heated; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I wiſh'd him to ſit down by the fire, and either drowſe or ſleep; ſo he ſlept about an hour, and wak'd very much refreſhed, and with great Exemption from thoſe Violent pains, and ſharp inflammations that afflicted him. And
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56217:32"/> after this manner was he plyed for ſome 14 days, in which time as his Diſtemper abated, his ſtomack and ſtrength advanced, and enabled him to paſs currantly about his occaſions, not ſtaying within Doors one hour for any thing he took, a convenience which he confeſſ'd trebled the charge of his Cure.</p>
            <p>After this I now and then for the nights gave him a quarter of a pint ſometimes of <hi>Salus,</hi> and other times <hi>Vindex,</hi> and <hi>Radix</hi> he uſed to carry about him, to take of it at all times. So in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, and theſe powerful Means, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence and venome of the Diſtemper was wholly driven outward into an Extream Itch, with which being ſomtime much moleſted, I gave him of <hi>Elixir vitae</hi> half a pint at a draught, and a quantity to take as much every night; And ſo with the Expence of 3 pints, abſolutely diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that alſo; and then he reckoned himſelf as well, and hearty as ever he was in his life.</p>
            <p>Now though moſt of the Medicines he took were of that heat, eſpecially the <hi>ſtella</hi> as would have affrighted any Practiſer whatſoever to have given one quarter of the quantity he at any time took; yet during all the time, he never found any inconvenience by heat or thirſt, or binding of his body, but on the contrary had ſtools much more then ordinary, and is become a Champion in defence of their Real Vertues, againſt all ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions he frequently met with, from ſuch as

            <p n="22">22. A young man taken very violently with griping in the Guts, and having continued ſo for a conſiderable time, his friends applying themſelves to me, I ſent him a quarter of a pint of <hi>Stella</hi> to be heated and drank off by him, and it perfectly cured him.</p>
            <p n="23">23. About the ſame time alſo a Gentleman between 30 and 40, taken with a violent Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Griping, the ſame quantity of <hi>Stella</hi> heated, abſolutely cured.</p>

            <p n="26">26. A Gentleman about thirty, naturally of much life and Spirit, ſorely moleſted with a Quartan Ague, upon recommendation of a friend who had great experience of my Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, earneſtly deſired my beſt aſſiſtance, and not to ſpare for coſt, ſo I plyed him daily with <hi>Radix,</hi> and every night with <hi>Salus,</hi> and with
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56217:33"/> 
               <hi>Vindex</hi> for his fit, and this for about 8 days at the leaſt without any ſign of abatement, or remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which as it was very much to his diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, ſo it made me alſo amaz'd to think of it, and reſolved, except I ſuddenly heard better news from what I then ſent him, to tell the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that came between us, that certainly there was ſomething in the buſineſs they had not diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or that Exceeded all I could comprehend, and to wiſh him to take ſome other Councel, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being more trouble ſome to my mind, then to ſee things go quite croſs to my reaſonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, but for five days after not hearing from him, I concluded he was either Dead, or had put him ſelf into other hands; But when I leaſt expected, the meſſenger came to me, deſiring me to ſend him ſomewhat to ſupport his ſpirits, as he went about his occaſions, I ask't what was become of his Ague, and found he was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quit of it; The party telling me that that night he took the laſt things I ſent him he had 6 or 7 large ſtools which quite Diſcharged his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, and that ever ſince he had been very well, only upon ſtirring a little faint: And truly this manner of effect I have often noted in obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Diſtempers, for that which I always give being not ſlight, inſignificant, but powerful friends to Nature, cannot poſſibly be utterly fruſtrate, but firſt or laſt muſt ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prevail for good, as here by Purgation, ſo
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56217:34"/> ſometimes by Vomit, when their forces by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent repetition become ſo united, as not to be reſiſted; And this way of Operation, as it hath Eſtabliſhed my hope in all I give; So may it be of good aſſurance to Patients though for a time they ſee little or no alteration; For that which is good in it ſelf, and powerful, and taken in full quantity, frequently when leaſt look't for, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth even above, and beyond all hope Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; And is the peculiar bleſſing of Prudence, in Patients, and Perſeverance under the uſe of means ſo certainly ſafe, and ſo prevalent as theſe upon all occaſions have been approved.</p>
            <p>But this Gentleman adventuring too much upon his mettle before confirmation of his ſtrength, before two moneths came to an end renewed his Ague; and being much nearer to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means then mine, ſell into the common Road of Phyſick, under which in few days he ended his life, ſomewhat under the blame of his Relations, for declining his own Reaſon and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, but is the uſual fruit of Inſtability, and Inconſtancy.</p>

            <p n="38">38. An Elderly Gentlewoman being taken with Extream Gripes and Looſneſs, ſeeking to me for help, miſſing of me, ſell into other hands, but finding no help, ſent to me, ſo I ſent her half a pint of <hi>Salus vitae</hi> to be taken at thrice in 3 hours time, which reſtored her perfectly to her health.</p>
            <p n="39">39. One who had three young Children all at one time ſick of Agues, I ordered her a quart of <hi>Sanguis</hi> to be given to each of them a ſpoonful two or three (as they would freely take) once in two hours, and Double the quantity in their fits in which courſe with three Quarts they all recovered.</p>
            <p n="40">40. A Gentlewoman troubled often with Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vevers and Fits of the Mother, generally recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Succus vitae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Her Husband alſo afflicted with an Extream Cough, which his neighbours would frequently tell him it would be a Church-yard Cough, which is an unhandſome way of Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherewith many do a great deal of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to weak people, by the uſe of <hi>Salus, Radix, Vindex, and Stella,</hi> perfectly recovered. And when after much buſſeling in buſineſs, he had contracted a moſt inveterate Ague, by theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines alſo he recovered. Alſo a ſon of theirs that had ſuch ſtrange Fits, that moſt that ſaw
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56217:37"/> him in them, would iudg him bewitcht, by help of <hi>Salus</hi> recovered. And a very young Child of theirs, taken with a moſt tearing violent hoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cough, by help of <hi>Succus vitae</hi> mixt with a third part of <hi>Refugium,</hi> ſoon quitted the hoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But then he fell into Convulſion Fits ſo fierce and frequent, that they never ſaw, nor I ever heard the like, in ſo much as they were out of all hope; yet ſo long as it lived would not omit the uſe of means, deſiring me to ſpare for nothing I thought might give it relief: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I ordered half a pint of <hi>Salus vitae,</hi> (the Child being Extreamly hot; thirſty, and Fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh alſo) to be given by a ſpoonful every half hour, ſo that was ſoon ſpent, and an other, and a third alſo, and then long and ſlippery ſtrong ſtools ſucceeded, after which he ſoon perfectly recovered: But this being a Family that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without <hi>Sanguis</hi> for ordinary occaſions; nor <hi>Lac vitae</hi> for worms, <hi>Salus vitae,</hi> or <hi>Radix:</hi> I ſhould be over large if I ſhould recount all the advantages they have recieved by them, and by which being taken in time, they prevent many miſchievous inconveniences.</p>
            <p n="41">41. A Gentleman about 30, having often reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from threatning ſickneſſes, and having ſeen his wife much aſſiſted by them in time of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, and his bothers Exceedingly relieved in Melancholly, and in Extream Fits of the Gout, is arrived to ſuch an Eſteem of their abſolute

            <p n="42">42. A young Gentlewoman full of Difficulty in Childbirth, upon taking 2 ounces of <hi>Vindex</hi> mixt with an ounce of the tincture of Saffron, (which I keep always in readineſs of an Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary vertue) inſtantly became a happy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But towards the end of the Moneth, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an Extream Cold, was afflicted with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Gripings, and Faintings that they could hardly keep life in her; ſo that ſhe was fain to take in a little ſpace 4 ounces of <hi>Vindex,</hi> and as much <hi>Stella,</hi> which ſoon eaſ'd her, and after thoſe half a pint of <hi>Radix,</hi> ſlowly uſed, perfected her health.</p>
            <p n="43">43. Another young Gentlewoman full of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty with her firſt Child-birth, found alſo preſent help by the laſt mentioned Cordial in like occaſions; and indeed, by long and large Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, ſtands as an undoubted aſſiſtant in all ſuch caſes: This Child alſo proving ſomewhat ſickly, and ſometime Dangerouſly, hath never failed of ſpeedy remedy, by <hi>Radix, Salus, Succus</hi> mixt with <hi>Refugium</hi> when fits appeared, and is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56217:38"/> ſo confirmed, that both for her ſelf, and husband, and friends as far as ſhe can perſwade with them theſe Medicines are ſolely depended on; and this not only becauſe of theſe Succeſſes, but wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with child, a bleeding took her, ſomewhat threatning, and other times fear of miſcarriage, having recourſe to theſe, ſhe became ſoon quit of her Diſtempers; So this alſo proves another teſtimony, of their fitneſs to be Eſtabliſhed <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick for Families.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="44">44. In the next place I ſhould recount the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold remarkable Cures performed by them in another worthy Family, Being the ſame, where that ſtrange recovery of the young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, referred to afore, and recited in the <hi>Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of Phyſick:</hi> But truly they are ſo many, that I chooſe rather to omit them all, then to make ſo large an Enumeration, Eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how ready they will be on any occaſion, to aver their ſafety and Efficacy in all Caſes, wherein they ever uſed them; and it is a very conſiderable time, that they have under
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56217:39"/> God ſolely Depended upon them, even in all Extremities.</p>
            <p n="45">45. A Gentleman well ſeen in my Medicines, comes haſtily to me for a Child Exceedingly troubled with Convulſion fits, ſo as there was very ſmall hope of life, and ſaid I, you will have me Engage, and ſo the Death of it (by thoſe that will neither underſtand you nor me) ſhall be imputed to what I ſent it, but he would have no Denial, ſo I ſent two ounces of <hi>Succus</hi> mixt with an ounce of <hi>Refugium,</hi> which given to the Child by ſpoonful and ſpoonful at neer an hours Diſtance, ſo prevailed, that the Child re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and had never any fit after it.</p>
            <p n="46">46. A Gentleman and no ſtranger to Phyſick, nor to my way, his Wife being Exceedingly and often afflicted with Mother-fits, and being to take a long journey, gave her a pint of <hi>Refugium,</hi> for her relief in caſe of extremity; And he told me afterwards ſhe thought it ſaved her life.</p>
            <p n="47">47. A Lad about fourteen or fifteen taken with a Violent pain and ſwelling in his knee, had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing given him to anoint it and a Plaiſter: but without any eaſe or remiſſion; his Miſtreſs tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me of it, I gave her half a pint of <hi>Sanguis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae,</hi> adviſing it be taken one half that night hot in bed, and the other half next night; ſhe laugh't and ſaid, this was Chirurgians work, what could <hi>Sanguis</hi> do to a ſwel'd knee, (ſhe was one who for her ſelf and Family had long time ſolely De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56217:39"/> on my Medicines, and ſo I did believe ſhe thought it Chyrurgians work, or ſhe had referred him to me at firſt) I told her 'twas no great nor Difficult matter I adviſed, yet ſuch as I hop'd would anſwer her deſire, ſo it was given, and the venom being extinguiſh't, the ſwelling fell, and the knee remained perfectly well as the other; And ſo I hope, neither I, nor my Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines ſhall ever be hit in the teeth with the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gableneſs of this Cure: Nor ſhall I inſiſt upon the manifold Cures performed for this Family, where there is always a readineſs to juſtifie, That there is no phyſick ſo proper for Families, as they are, at leaſt in their judgments.</p>
            <p n="48">48. A Gentlewoman between 30 and 40, in Difficulty of Chidbirth, ſpeedily relieved by the Cordial afore mentioned, but before the end of the moneth, ſtriving above ſtrength to be a Nurſe, fell into a moſt tedious Ague, of which in about ten Days being cured, by the continual taking plenty o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56217:40"/> leaſt mittigation, but ſettled with ſuch perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and ſuch intollerable pains in her ſtomack, that greater could not be imagin'd, whereupon I inquired how it was with her, as to her natural courſe, and found they had long time been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſo then immediately I cauſ'd her to take a pint of <hi>vis vitae</hi> in three hours time; upon which in the middeſt and heighth of her torment ſhe would fall faſt aſleep for two hours together, and ſo by plying her day and night only there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, in leſs then a weeks time, no one could be in a more ſetled or healthful condition.</p>
            <p>But ſhe alſo is one of a Family, That from the youngeſt to the Eldeſt for all occaſions (and very many they have had) ſolely under God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon theſe medicines, and very much to their ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p n="49">49. A Gentleman near 30, overwrought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs matters of Importance, admitting no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment upon a journey in bad ways and weather, returned ſomewhat ill, yet ſo as he was enforced next morning to begin another, when (as one ſaid after) there was ſome appearance of the Small Pox, yet then he muſt go, or the opportunity ever loſt, 'twas not far, but tedious through his indiſpoſition, and matters ſorting to his mind, bore up for his return home, but no ſooner there, but head, and heart, and ſtomack moſt violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of order; ſo, as one who with his whole Family had long depended ſolely under God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56217:40"/> my Meſticines; He took a large quantity of <hi>Salus,</hi> as upon half a pint in three hours time, and laſt at night, 4 ounces of <hi>Vindex</hi> towards morning, his wife perceived apparent ſigns of the Small Pox, but for fear of Diſcouraging him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare to ſpeak of it, withal a violent looſneſs took him, which being upon thoſe Cordials could not have been hurtful, had he not in that caſe through diſlike of his attendant upon every occaſion riſen out of his bed, upon which taking cold as the looſneſs increaſed, ſo the Pimples ſank in, and an Extream Fever enſued; with head-ake, thirſt, and reſtleſneſs, and which though he took <hi>Radix,</hi> and <hi>Salus</hi> hourly, and every night laſt, <hi>Vindex,</hi> or <hi>vita</hi> or <hi>Clavis,</hi> or <hi>Athlaeta,</hi> beſides within night the <hi>Arcanum, Stella, Refugium,</hi> &amp;c. yet in three days time there was no vſiible remiſſion, but rather advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards lightneſs of head, with a Mouth and Throat, ſore and ſcurft all over. Beſides my care, he had a Worthy and skilful friend that often viſited him; But ſeeing the courſe taken, preſerved from Extreams, Did not in the leaſt interpoſe; at length noting how great a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he had taken, and the ſmall effect produced, being full of thoughtfulneſs, I grew jealous of my Medicines, and propoſed to mine; and his Worthy Friend, the uſe of Coolers, which upon conſideration was aſſented to, and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ordered: But upon this Reſolve, ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56217:41"/> upon the high venomous nature of the Diſtemper: That all along he was admitted White-wine Poſſet-drink, and in four hours time a Draught of Beer and Sugar, with a toaſt which moiſtened and cooled as much as conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſafety: that in al my undertakings I never ſaw cauſe to accuſe my Medicines, nor in this neither; For though his Looſneſs was ſtaid in due time, yet once in eight or ten hours he had conſtantly a well conſiſting ſtool; That now if I ſhould withdraw theſe, and fal to cooling Drinks, Ptiſans or Juleps, I might pleaſe the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, but weaken nature, that only by the utmoſt ſtrength and virtue of my beſt Cordials could be enabled to go through with this Conflict: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon immediately I put into his hands near up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on three quarters of a pint of <hi>Salus,</hi> to take of it continually as much as he pleas'd, which liking him very well, he followed it to purpoſe, ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſoundly for two hours together, and waking chearful and full of hope: Upon this alſo, upon little Coughings he brought up large quantities of a thick ropy flegm, like whites of Eggs, which hardly parted from his mouth by plucking, and this frequently both night and Day; During all which time, he took very large quantities of <hi>Radix, Salus, Vindex, Arcanum,</hi> and the reſt forementioned, ſleeping conveniently, and waking without ſadneſs or ſickiſhneſs: And upon a ſuddain ſeem'd to himſelf ſo well and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56217:41"/> couragious, that I wiſhing him to forbear ſpeech, and Diſpoſe himſelf to reſt, he laught at me, and told me if I would not otherwiſe be convinc't, he would riſe and come home to me, I wiſh't him rather to believe me than himſelf, and towards night he ſhould try his ſtrength in ſitting up for his refreſhment, ſo I quieted him, but ſo that he would have a Chicken prepared for his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; So when time came, his fancy helpt him to riſe pretty heartily, and with a little help to move near the fire, where he would fain have been well, and cal'd for his Diet, but alas could not endure the ſmell, nor ſwallow one bit, but changed in a moment, and ſo haſts to bed, where finding himſelf ſomewhat refreſh'd, was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, but ſaid he perceived he muſt have patience awhile; ſo within a Day and a Night after, his Flegm began to ceaſe, his head quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his thirſt ſlak't, his mouth, and tongue, and throat clear'd, and his appetite c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56217:42"/> of his ſmall Pox, being by the mighty Efficacy of thoſe Medicines forced upward and caſt out, and though he purged no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> at all, but as Cordials which he took every night after, for a week at leaſt, purged him, yet no ill effect followed, unleſs the peeling of his hands and feet ſhould be taken for one, which indeed witneſſeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the poiſonous quality of the diſtemper, and powerful benignity of the Medicine, then any remnants or reliques of malignity: And as this, through Gods mercy, thus happily ended, ſo ſhould all the advantages received by this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily from theſe Medicines: Were there no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they might very well paſs for a currant teſtimony, that they very well deſerve, in a moſt ſignal ſenſe, to be ſtiled, <hi>True and Real Phyſick for Families;</hi> as I am ſure they are always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to teſtifie.</p>
            <p n="50">50. A young Gentlewoman very big with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, upon taking Cold, was ſo extremely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with continual violent Coughing, that her friends thought it impoſſible but ſhe muſt miſcarry; but being well acquainted with theſe Medicines, every time ſhe cought, ſhe took a good ſup of <hi>Radix vitae,</hi> which amounted to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a pint in one night, and ſo quitted her ſelf both of her fear, trouble, and danger, and this without any the leaſt ſhadow of inconvenience enſuing, either by burning, drying, or binding. And if this be not an undoubted witneſs both of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56217:42"/> their ſafety and efficacy, the moſt diffident being Judges, let no evidence henceforth be of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute amongſt Practitioners.</p>
            <p n="51">51. One about 50, of a full body, upon a fall bruiſing the knee, breaking the skin, and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with much painfulneſs, plying her twice a day with <hi>Vis vitae,</hi> and every night laſt with two ounces of <hi>Vindex, Salus,</hi> and <hi>Fermentum naturae,</hi> in a weeks time was perfectly recovered.</p>
            <p n="52">52. A Maid, through Cold taken, and Stoppa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, her face became ſo ſwell'd and pain'd, as was intollerable; but with <hi>Vis vitae</hi> for daies, and <hi>Salus,</hi> and <hi>Fermentum,</hi> and <hi>Radix</hi> for nights, in a weeks time ſhe became very well in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
            <p n="53">53. A Gentleman being very crazy after a tedious ſickneſs, and yet by reaſon of urgent buſineſs forced upon a long journey in dead of Winter, taking with him half a pint of <hi>Salus vitae,</hi> reckoned it preſerved him from many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, that in probability might have cauſed ſome dangerous relapſes.</p>
            <p n="54">54. A Gentlewoman between 30 and 40, apt through helping others, to run many hazards in her own health, upon a great Cold was taken with violent Gripings and Looſneſs, which hung upon her very tediouſly; at length ſhe ſent to me, and I ſent her half a pint of <hi>Refugium,</hi> to take half preſently, and the reſt three hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, both well warm'd, which perfectly cured her.</p>

            <p n="56">56. A Gentleman near 40, long afflicted with an Ague, being at length cured by no ordinary Phyſick, but ſuch as by forcible Vomits and Looſners, extremely weakned him, ſo far as none had any hopes of his life: Having ſome knowledge of my Medicines, from large experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his friends, ſent to me, deſiring I would well conſider what might revive his drooping and ſinking ſpirits; I ſent him a pint of <hi>Vis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae,</hi> which perfectly raiſed and reſtor'd him.</p>
            <p n="57">57.

            <p n="58">58. A young Girl, ſo ill, that the Parents knew not what to think of her, and uſing all u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual means, but prevailing nothing, deſired my advice; I gave two ounces of <hi>Clavis,</hi> which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Child by a ſpoonful every hour, ſoon gave an appearance to the Small Pox, which

            <p n="59">59. The like ſervice theſe Medicines perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a younger Child of the ſame Parents; but this proving ſomewhat more threatning, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> and <hi>Vindex</hi> were imployed to its compleat recovery.</p>

A Gentleman about 30, by occaſion of buſineſs, adding illneſs to illneſs, thickned it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a moſt violent Fever, with violent pains in his head, vehement thirſt and ſoreneſs all over his body, with reſtleſneſs: I began with him with three ounces of <hi>Vindex,</hi> for the firſt night, and the uſe of White-wine Poſſet, and in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he found himſelf ſo well, that he roſe out of bed; but unhappily, for by occaſion he ventured to the renewing of his Cold, and that day was very much out of order; then for next night I gave him the ſame quantity of <hi>Vindex,</hi> and next morning found himſelf ſo well, that friends com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about buſineſs, he would needs riſe, and did, to ſpeak with them; and ſo again loſt all the advantage he had gained, and ſo rooted his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, that for two days and nights after the event was ſadly feared: But every night I plyed him with <hi>Salus,</hi> or <hi>Vindex,</hi> and all day long with <hi>Radix,</hi> to take continnally; but all prevailing very little, he grew much diſcouraged; yet fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him ſo cloſe with the moſt powerful Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, the moſt threatning Signs were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, and the worſt that appeared ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56217:44"/> for he had reſt and evacuation, and his tongue, and throat, and thirſt moderated; but as he ſeemed to amend, it ſetled into a ſecond day Ague, with a very bad Cold, and very long and tedious hot Fits: But as this ſomewhat quitted the mortal fears of his friends, ſo was I well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied I had it at that paſs; for I accompt not any Ague difficult, where (as here) the Patient is eaſily ordered, and willing to give time, without limitation of coſt: So every night I gave him three ounces of <hi>Salus,</hi> and half a pint of <hi>Vis vitae,</hi> every day, to take by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle all day long; and for his Fits half a pint of <hi>Refugium</hi> to take well heated, one half of it juſt before, or in the beginning of his Fit, and the reſt at times before it ended, and ſo by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees his Fits were leſſened, and his well days and nights without head-ach, or ſickneſs, and in ſhort time at a final end, without any thing, but ſome three nights two ounces of <hi>Vindex,</hi> to throw out the dead or killed dog; and he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately followed his occaſions, free from all faintneſs or infirmity, which would hardly have been ſo, had he bled, or vomited, or purged, and been bliſtered; as in other hands he would have been, though it might have coſt him his life: But this good ſpeed, as I take it, the whole time being not above ten days, next to Gods bleſſing, is very much to be imputed to the quiet reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Patient (above moſt) to all directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56217:45"/> and cautions adviſed, eſpecially after once he ſaw the leaſt hazard or adventure run him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to inconvenience; and may ſtand, as an example of great advantage and worthy to be followed by all ſick perſons, with all patience, and prudent reſolution.</p>

This Friend ſeeing her in this ſad condition, put her in mind of my Medicines, telling her, if ſhe were free from other Phyſick, 'twas very likely, as bad as ſhe was, ſhe might receive good by them: So ſhe took her counſel, and had in ſome three days three half pints of <hi>Refugium,</hi> which perfectly recovered her, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave her liberty to follow her occaſions.</p>

A Child about 3 years old, almoſt paſt hope, through a Fever and Surfeit, and bad Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, paſt all hope of the Parents' recovered, by twice three ounces of <hi>Salus vitae,</hi> taking two ſpoonful every hour till it was ſpent, White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine Poſſet being its conſtant Drink.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56217:48"/> ſpare for no coſt in his behalf; but if not, he would immediately ſend him home to his friends. So the man taking plenty of <hi>Stella, Vindex,</hi> and <hi>Salus,</hi> in one day and nights time became per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well.</p>
            <p n="84">83. A young Gentlewoman, being far gone of her firſt Child, illiſh and ſickiſh often, upon apprehenſion of very near danger, taking a fright, grew ſo il, as al her friends doubted an immediate miſcarriage; but her Husband always furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Stella, &amp;c.</hi> prevailing with her to take two ounces, compleatly ſetled her.</p>
            <p>I hope the Reader will not think much of his pains in caſting up the charge of theſe Cures, for ſatisfying the charitable repinings of ſuch Artiſts, as ſtill ſighingly bewail the dearneſs of my Medicines: For indeed this laſt, out of which how much money they would fetch, let thoſe judge who are uſed to the coſtlineſs of their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, the length of their time, and largeneſs of their Bills, this no inconſiderable Cure coſt 18 pence, that afore it about 5 s.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56217:49"/> and dejected by the violent griping, tearing pains of Vomiting and Looſneſs, inſomuch that he exceedingly doubted how it would go with him, deſiring my advice. A friend of his alſo being very ill likewiſe, I gave him a full half pint of <hi>Stella;</hi> he drank the far greater part himſelf, and his friend the reſt; but ſuch an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration did it immediately make in him, that in an inſtant he fell into diſcourſe, with that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and chearfulneſs, as if he had quite forgot his ſickneſs, or had not been ſick at all. And ſo alſo was it with his friend; and both perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovered, without any after complaint or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience; and this at 6 s. was thought no hard bargain.</p>
            <p n="86">85. A Gentlewoman about 30, grievouſly tormented with Gripes, and Looſneſs, by half a pint of <hi>Salus,</hi> taking half at ten in the forenoon, and the reſt laſt at night, perfectly recovered: and about a week after, taking Cold again, and falling into the ſame diſtemper, by the like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity again recovered, and continued in health; nor was this thought dear, though both Cures coſt 8 s.</p>

An ingenious Gentleman, long time troubled with melancholly, and in hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, tyred out with Phyſick, being by his Friend poſſeſt of my own, and my Medicines lity, put both himſelf and his Purſe freely into my Cere: I was the beſt Husband I could for him, and yet was forced, except I would trifle out my Truſt, between the 10th and 25th of <hi>March,</hi> to put him to full three pound coſt, but ſo much to his contentment and recovery, that I never took more joy, then to note his Noble and generous rejoycing in the pleaſantneſs of his Medicines, wondring that things ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant could be ſo efficacious as he found them. This Cure was performed by a quart of <hi>Radix,</hi> and a pint of <hi>Salus,</hi> deliver'd the 10th day of <hi>March,</hi> the <hi>Radix</hi> for the day, and the <hi>Salus</hi> for the night.

I cauſe her to be let blood in her left arm, and that the Gliſter, and Julep ſhould be repeated, to anoint her breaſt with Oyl of Violets, and that ſhe lick frequently ſome Sirrops of Violets; after the blood-letting ſhe was preſently eaſed &amp; that ſenſe of weight and burning in her Cheſt were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On the tenth day in the morning ſhe was better, her Fever and other Symptoms were very remiſs.

            <p>On the eleventh day, which was the third of her ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, moved with what I had obſerved in another Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe of the ſame patient, in which ſhe was afflicted by turns, with a Flux of her Belly joyned with a <hi>Teneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and a <hi>Catarrh</hi> falling upon her breaſt, So that as often as her looſneſs ſtopt, ſhe was grievouſly afflicted with her Catarrh, and when her Flux recovered, her Catarrh preſently ceaſed; The humour falling into her breaſt, being drawn downwards, I conceived that a Purge would do her moſt good, which I made after this manner.</p>

            <p>The fourth day of her Diſeaſe, and the twelfth of the moneth, when as in the morning her Fever and the pain in her Chanel bone continued. Dr. <hi>Ranchinus</hi> was again called to Conſult, and beſides the foreſaid Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, a great palpitation of the heart, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo in her right Hypocondrium, alſo in her right ſide; but it laſted not long there. But about her heart it continued, and did beat like a Hammer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, ſhe was again <hi>Let blood in her right Arm.</hi> And an Ovntment was appointed for the part pained, and Remedies to revel the humours to the lower parts: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Evening the Diſeaſe was again exaſperated, and the Palpitation continued, ſome hours after ſhe did ſweat a little all her body over, by which ſhe was a little eaſed; But her Palpitation and Fever continued as before, when we began to ſuſpect that Vapours did ariſe from her Womb we preſcribed her a Gliſter for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Frictions, Ligatures,</hi> and Cupping-glaſſes to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to her lower parts, Emplaſtrum Hyſtericum was applyed to her Navel; and a Julep was given her, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt her ſweating, of Scabious and Carduus water with Bezoar ſtone, and half an ounce of Orange flower wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in regard of her womb. In the night ſhe had three
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56217:58"/> large ſtools of ſtinking corrupt matter: after midnight ſhe ſlept quietly till morning.</p>
            <p>On the fifth day of the Diſeaſe, I found her in the morning with a ſmall Fever, without any oppreſſion in her breaſt, or any pain, and with very little Palpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heart, about Evening ſhe did ſweat a little, and was better afterwards. After ſhe had voided her Gliſter, her palpition was augmented, her Fever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more intenſe, and ſhe was pretty well in the Night.</p>
            <p>On the ſixth day, all things were as before, in the Evening Cupping-glaſſes were applyed with ſcarrifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton which did her good.</p>
            <p>On the ſeventh day her Courſes began to flow plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, by which means all Symptoms were verymuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated.</p>
            <p>On the eighth day ſhe was better.</p>
            <p>On the ninth day ſhe had a light looſneſs joyned with a Teneſmus, by which ſhe voided few Flegmatick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and before that looſneſs, ſhe vomited much bitter ſtuff, the Humours were prepared with tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate aperitives.</p>
            <p>On the tenth day, which was the eighteenth day of the Moneth her looſneſs was leſs, at night it ſtopt quite, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On the 29. of the ſaid Moneth of <hi>April,</hi> when ſhe felt

            <p>Her body being opened, her <hi>Mediaſtinum</hi> was found full of wheyiſh blood, which peradventure, the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane</hi> being broken towards the upper part of the Lungs, and preſſing the ſame, and the <hi>Aſpera Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria,</hi> might ſuddenly choak her, moreover the whole ſubſtance of the Lungs was found full of purulent matter, exceeding heavy: Alſo her left Teſticle was as big as a ſmall Egg, of a blackiſh colour, and as it were Gangrenated, yea and as ſoon as it was open'd, there leapt out of the middle of her Teſticle, a certain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter like a Nut-kernel, and very like a putriſied clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of blood; we conjectured that to have been the cauſe of her Mother-fits, to which ſhe was very much ſubject, yea peradventure the Palpitation of her heart aroſe from thence, <hi>viz.</hi> From the filthy vapours aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that part.</p>
            <p>Here you have a very ſmooth Story, yet of ſo unquiet, rugged, pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56217:59"/> Condition, and divers times Gliſters, Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Cuppings, and Scarrifications, and purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be here very plauſibly delivered, as if the Fears, Troubles and Diſturbances, theſe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending were not at all felt, or thought on by the Patient, yet whoever ſenſibly conſiders the many toſſings, and turmoilings this ſick and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der perſon was exerciſed withal, during her ten Dayes ſickneſs, can hardly avoid believing, but that it was even without any other Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſufficient to have brought any weak perſon to their end, or far towards it, nor can I but firmly apprehend, That if any Patient taken as is here expreſt, ſhould for ſuch a time be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly plyed with <hi>Refugium, Vindex, Salus, Vita naturae, Clavis</hi> or <hi>Radix,</hi> being all ſtrengthners of Nature, and of Power to ſubdue the veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous cauſes of Diſtempers, I ſay ſo plyed, I can hardly ſee it poſſible, but that recovery muſt neceſſarily follow.</p>
            <p>And therefore, truly the courſe taken, was, and is ſtill to be bewailed, and much the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe in this ye are to reckon, that (<hi>ex un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue Leonem</hi>) you have a full proſpect of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally approved Practice of Phyſick, The Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Quinteſſence, &amp; maſter-piece, not of a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but of a Teacher, and moſt Reverent Author and Doctor in the Science, ſuch as who ever
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56217:60"/> follows, may Authentically ſubſcribe <hi>Secundum Artem</hi> to all their Preſcriptions and Proceedings, for which they are both praiſ'd, and liberally pai'd too; And wherewithal their patients (ſpeed how they will) muſt be contented.</p>
            <p>And yet, who ſo blind, as with half an eye doth not ſee what extream uncertainty this Learned perſon was at, throughout his whole Engagement in this Diſtemper; how ſlenderly diſcerning of the Cauſe how weakly judging of the alterations; how inſenſible of the Patients molleſtations by Gliſters, Bliſters, &amp;c. how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of her loſs of blood and Spirit, which though very fruitleſs, yet often repeated, of how little uſe his Learning, and former reading ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herein, how inſignificant all his former open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Anatomiſing of Bodies appeared here, where he was afreſh fain to open his Patient to learn what her Diſeaſe was; And being open'd, how meanly he Gueſſes, taking notice meerly of <hi>apparent,</hi> defects of Parts, (which are but <hi>Effects</hi>) without any conſideration of the cauſe thereof, which indeed <hi>is the Diſeaſe, and indiſcernable, but by the Intellectual eye of the underſtanding:</hi> Alſo how poorly he was furniſhed with Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, of ſo mean, caſual, and hazardous qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, as not in the leaſt ſtrengthened but
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56217:60"/> weakned nature, through which ſhe fell. So that the whole considered, to any rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience I think there will appear a cauſe, for all I have ſaid or done, In this weighty affair of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and Medicines; and cannot but judg that the World h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But it doth not appear to have then been thought of, nor ever since to any considerable purpoſe, for though Chymiſtry hath ſtruck in with large and fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l pretences, and fil'd our heads with new Bookiſh Tearms, and Notions, yet have they afforded us ſcarce any thing but vapouring Fancies, Myſteries, and Riddles, the proper iſſue of Vain-glorious and Superſtitious Reformers, who though very bad Leaders, themſelves, being led by Quicksilver and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, have had the fortune yet, to be both admired and followed by every Student in this uſeful Art; But with ſo little Fruit, not one Maſter Medicine yet appearing, that it would amaze ones Reaſon even to aſtoniſhment; But
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56217:61"/> that vain windy hopes, and oſtentous ſhews or ſhadows, have ever been of more eſteem then ſubſtances, and uſeful realities, but if hence forward it ſhould be better, I to this piece will deem my ſelf a debtor.</p>
            <p>And ſo in time I doubt not will others alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, for however ſome may ſtill ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perſiſt even againſt the teſtimony of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances, one while to fright people from their uſe upon pretenſe of their heat, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles to accuſe them of impotency by reaſon of their mildneſs, yet have I not found all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſo partially inclined. I here being one, and he neither young nor mean, who having taſted all with very much attention and ſatisfaction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly affirmed, that in producing that Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Medicines, ſo qualified, as the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars imported, and the inſtances manifeſted, I had done a more real ſervice to Physick, then either <hi>Hippocrates Galen, Paracelſus, Vanhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> or any other he had ever Read or Heard of. And that could He Produce them in that perfection <hi>I</hi> did, he would not ſtay many dayes in <hi>England. I</hi> told him his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the place he aimed at, and he confeſſed <hi>I</hi> gueſſed right, but I thuoght the place that bred them beſt deſervd them, though but for their ſakes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56217:61"/> who eſteem them equal to this high Encomium, how <hi>Ironically</hi> ſoever given.</p>
            <p>And to double this ſingle Wonder, one alſo there is who for years hath laid the main weight of his Practiſe upon their Aſſiſtance, to his full ſatisfaction in all ſorts of Diſtempers, and <hi>I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve would hardly be drawn to practice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, yet never askt what one Particular was in any of them; his taſt and aſſurance of me at firſt being his warrant, but now uſeth them with the ſame confidence and familiarity as <hi>I</hi> do, or as if they were his own preparations, ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being poor and abject, in caſee of ſo great a truſt.</p>
            <p>Another Grave and Learned perſon of high Degree in Art, taſting and wondering at their ſo unexpected qualifications, to his extream con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, did not, as others, vainly dignifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by ſpurting out Latine or Greek Sentences, Enquire whether <hi>I</hi> had travailed, or at what Univerſity <hi>I</hi> had ſtudied. As if right Reaſon were not alike in every Language, and in every place on this ſide, or beyond the Seas, being indeed, more or leſs, as it is Diligently, Circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Pertinently, and Honeſtly exerciſed. But that grave Gentleman askt ſuch a Queſtion, not
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56217:62"/> of me neither, (ſo truly civil was he) but of a By-ſtander, which when <hi>I</hi> was told, pleaſ'd me abundantly, to find one prudent Queſtion amongſt ſo many others, frequently obtruded upon me, very much ſhewing the vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the inward furniture of men, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring matter to me of very grateful contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</p>
            <p>Some other ſuch like Congratulatory Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies I might further alledg, did I lay much weight upon them, but in this Caſe it being with Medicines as with men, if their <hi>performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> commend them well and good, and for <hi>thoſe</hi> the inſtances are throughly to be conſidered, if theſe ſpeak in their commendations, all other praiſes, though thank-worthy, are but ſupernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merary.</p>
            <p>However upon the whole, here is <hi>Ars longa abbreviata,</hi> a Phyſick tendered to general uſe, and fair Example that needs feel no Pulſes, regards not Urines, Critical Dayes, Climacterical years, ſtate of the Moon, or poſition of the Stars, ſight of the Patient, viſits, Diagnoſticks, nor Prognoſticks; That troubles not the head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Circulation, Chilification, or Sanguifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, That values not Anatomy, as the to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56217:62"/> of Diſeaſes, nor the four, nor the three, nor the five Principles, nor the Doctrine of Fermentation, nor the fine ſpun Thred of Atoms, as any whit advantagious to Cure. That is not beholden to any Book or Books of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, or Phyſick for its production, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then to Diſcern the weakneſſes of what had been ſo highly, but cauſeleſly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: That ſtands not obliged to any Chymical or Laboratory Inſtructers, nor eſteems of their numerous tearms of Art, but as wit ſeldom fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Excellencies, without which Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry like Honor without Vertue, is but a mere Name to bragge withal, as moſt make on't.</p>
            <p>A Phyſick yet, which is the firſt hath dared to be brought within compaſs, and to be liable to be tryed whether true or falſe, fit, or unfit for the Sublime Nature of man, by certain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceivable marks, few &amp; easie to be underſtood, Whoſe Principle is from above, in Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſuited to the true humane Conſtitution, and powerfully Efficacious for Extirpation, and Extinguiſhing the venomous Cauſes of Diſeaſes, that is not at any time either unſafe or unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and keeps good for years in all Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates.</p>
            <p>And yet a Phyſick, as the Diſcourſe plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56217:63" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſheweth, that without any trouble or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the sick, may more rationally then any other, be confidently relied on for Cure, in all Caſes and Extremities.</p>
            <p>Why then, A Physick bringing ſo many large Exemptions to the Sick: And that acquits Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians from ſo many encumbrances and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, both in their ſtudies and practiſe, ſhould not with all chearfulneſs, and freeneſs be ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably entertained, Conſcience in time will judg: with which being much ſatisfied, I ſhall here put a period to all farther Expoſtulation or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation: Referring the iſſue of all my Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, To that Wiſdom which governs the World; and which ought to bear Rule, above all partial intereſts, in all the Thoughts, Words, Actions, and Conſciences of all Mankind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rational, Learne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
